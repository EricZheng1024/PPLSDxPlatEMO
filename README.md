(Re)Implementation:
- Improving Pareto Local Search Using Cooperative Parallelism Strategies for Multiobjective Combinatorial Optimization. TCYB, 2024.
- PPLS/D: Parallel Pareto Local Search Based on Decomposition. TCYB, 2020.

Note:
- Before use, add PlatEMO v3.x to MATLAB's search path. 
- Example usage is provided in `testPPLSD.m`.
- For older versions of MATLAB, you may need to use files suffixed with "2022a".
- For GUI integration, refer to the files suffixed with "PlatEMOALG".

The ACN strategy is documented [here](https://github.com/EricZheng1024/MOEA-D-ACN).
